        <p>Last Revision Date: 6/10/2021</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</p>
        <p>The Services and Websites are meant to provide you a means to review your personal and business finance and/or credit information for educational purposes only, and to manage if and to the extent you so choose, and may notify you of commercial credit opportunities and other products and services that may be available to you and your business entity through Trak or through third parties (such as, among other things, advertisements or offers for available credit cards, loan options, business products or services, or credit related products or services and other offers to you and/or your business entity, the ability to track and collect certain credit information specific to you and/or your business entity, including but not limited to, credit score, loan and credit card monthly payment, total amount and interest rates). The Services and Websites are meant for you and your business’s use only. The Services and Websites may also provide you other third-party products or services. This includes receiving offers free of charge for various credit or other financial products or services based upon your self-identified credit attributes, the attributes of your business entity (and/or your consumer report and credit score and business entity’s commercial credit report and score). These offers may also be generic and may not contain offers based on information specific to you or your business entity. </p>
        <p>We will identify those Services that are provided to you free of charge. Some of the Services (including Premium and Premium Plus) require a fee at the time of Service purchase or enrollment. By purchasing such Services and providing payment information, you represent that you are authorized to utilize the payment method presented and agree to pay the specified fee for paid Services, including any method offered or used through a mobile application.

You may downgrade your account by contacting Customer Support or by using any other method specified on the Websites. For the sake of clarity, downgrading your account will not cancel your membership. To cancel your account in its entirety and no longer receive Services, you must cancel your account by contacting Customer Support or by using any other method specified on the Websites and expressly cancel your account to no longer receive such Service. In all events, your account with Trak, (including your access to and use of any Services and Websites, and regardless of whether you upgrade or downgrade any Services while maintaining your account), shall be governed by this Agreement and these Terms and Conditions.</p>

As discussed above, and for your convenience, we may provide various other third-party websites that may be of interest to you. The third party offers or links that may be displayed on a Website are from third party companies from which Trak may receive compensation. Compensation may impact how, where or whether a third party product, service or link appears on a Website.

        <p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION<br>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
        <p>MOST CUSTOMER CONCERNS CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY AND TO THE CUSTOMER’S SATISFACTIONBY CALLING TRAK ́S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT AT 855-226-8388. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENTTHAT TRAK ́S CUSTOMER SUPPORT DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAYHAVE TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF TRAK HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE IT HASWITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSEDISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OFGENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. ARBITRATION IS MOREINFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT. ARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF AJUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERYLIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT ACOURT CAN AWARD. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON ANINDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. TRAK WILL PAYALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS.HOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, BOTH YOU AND TRAK WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS ́FEES FROM THE OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU WOULD BE IN COURT.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong></p>
        <p>(a) Trak and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except any disputes or claims which undergoverning law are not subject to arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted andto make all disputes and claims between us subject to arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. It includes,but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort,statute (including, without limitation, the Credit Repair Organizations Act) fraud, misrepresentation or any otherlegal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating toadvertising); claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a memberof a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. </p>
        <p>For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to “Trak,” “you,” and “us” shall include our respective parententities, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, websites of theforegoing, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services, products or information underthis or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action insmall claims court. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Trak are each waiving the right to atrial by jury or to participate in a class action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, andthus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. Thisarbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice ofDispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Trak should be addressed to: Legal &amp; Compliance, Trak, 517 N Mountain Ave.,Suite 205 Upland, CA 91786(“Notice Address”). The Notice must describe the nature and basis of the claim ordispute and set forth the specific relief you seek from Trak(“Demand”). If Trak and you do not reach an agreementto resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Trak may commence an arbitrationproceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Trak or you shall not be disclosedto the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Trak is entitled.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>You may obtain more information about arbitration from www.adr.org.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>(c) After Trak receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptlyreimburse you for your payment of the filing fee. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000, but issubject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, Trak will pay it directly uponreceiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial DisputeResolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAARules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administeredby the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or bywriting to the Notice Address.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision as wellas the Agreement ́s other terms and conditions, and the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any such dispute relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision or any other term of this Agreementincluding, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this arbitration provision or Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. Unless Trak and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Trak will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Trak for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. </p>
        <p>(d) The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding or in the final award, pursuant to applicable law and the AAA Rules.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>(e) Discovery and/or the exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>(f) YOU AND TRAK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR ORITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASSOR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Trak agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subparagraph(f) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>(g) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Trak makes any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your membership in any credit monitoring or other product, you may reject any such change and require Trak to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises regarding such membership product.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>FCRA DISCLOSURES</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The FCRA allows you to obtain a copy of all of the information in your consumer credit file disclosure from any consumer credit reporting company for a reasonable charge. The FCRA also states that individuals are entitled to receive a disclosure directly from the consumer credit reporting company free of charge under the following circumstances: </p>
        <ul role="list"> </ul>
        <p>&gt; You have been denied credit, insurance or employment in the past 60 days as a result of your report </p>
        <ul role="list"> </ul>
        <p>&gt; You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the 60-day period beginning on the day you make the certification </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>&gt; You are a recipient of public welfare assistance </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>&gt; You have reason to believe that your file at the agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their credit report without charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information from Trak to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your consumer credit file or to receive a copy of your consumer disclosure. </p>
        <p>The credit report you are requesting from Trak is not intended to constitute the disclosure of consumer credit information required by the FCRA or similar state laws. Such consumer disclosures must be obtained directly from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax, Transunion). </p>
        <p>The FCRA allows consumers to get one free comprehensive disclosure of all of the information in their credit file from each of the three national credit reporting companies (Experian, Equifax®, and TransUnion®) once every 12months through a central source. Georgia residents can receive two disclosures per year. Although comprehensive, the credit reports from one or all of the three national credit reporting companies that are available from Trak may not have the same information as a credit report obtained directly from the three national credit reporting companies or through the central source. To request your free annual report under the FCRA, you must go towww.annualcreditreport.com, or call 877-322-8228. Trak’s Products are not related to the free FCRA disclosure that you are or may be entitled to.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Consumers Have The Right To Obtain A Security Freeze </p>
        <p>You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report, which will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing information in your credit report without your express authorization. The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gets access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding a new loan, credit, mortgage, or any other account involving the extension of credit.</p>
        <p>As an alternative to a security freeze, you have the right to place an initial or extended fraud alert on your credit file at no cost. An initial fraud alert is a 1-year alert that is placed on a consumer’s credit file. Upon seeing a fraud alert display on a consumer’s credit file, a business is required to take steps to verify the consumer’s identity before extending new credit. If you are a victim of identity theft, you are entitled to an extended fraud alert, which is a fraud alert lasting 7 years. </p>
        <p>A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity, with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>None of our services for which you pay us money, including our credit monitoring services, are offered or provided with respect to the extension of credit by third parties. You are paying us only for credit monitoring services. You are not paying us to advise you or assist you in obtaining a loan or improving your credit record, history, rating or Score.

You acknowledge and agree that you are not seeking to purchase, use, or access any of the Products, Product Websites, and Content in order to do so.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Accurate adverse information on your credit report cannot be changed. If you believe that your credit reportcontains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is your responsibility to contact the relevant credit reportingcompany, and follow the appropriate procedures for notifying the credit reporting company that you believe thatyour credit report contains an inaccuracy. Any information provided to you regarding the procedures followed bythe various credit reporting companies related to the removal of inaccurate, non-fraudulent information is providedwithout charge to you and is available for free. Any such information is not included as part of your credit scoremonitoring product but is provided free of charge to all consumers, regardless of whether they are members of thecredit score monitoring product.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>VantageScore 3.0®</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The VantageScore, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by VantageScore Solutions, LLC to help you see and understand how lenders view your credit worthiness. It is not a FICO score and is not usually used by lenders, but it is indicative of your overall credit risk. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you ́ll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Your credit score is based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit score can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. And since the information in your file can change over time, your credit score may be different from day-to-day. </p>
        <p>Lenders and insurers use several different credit scoring models so don’t be surprised if your lender gives you a score that ́s different from the VantageScore 3.0 you receive online. Just remember that your associated risk level is generally the same even if the number is not. If the lender ́s score is lower than your online score, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>
